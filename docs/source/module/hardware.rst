Arduino Boards:
---------------
An Arduino board is a microcontroller-based platform that can be used to build custom macro keyboards. With an Arduino board and the right components, such as a key matrix and buttons, it is possible to create a keyboard with specific functions and macros, allowing users to automate repetitive tasks and improve their workflow. The Arduino software development environment provides a user-friendly interface for programming the board and creating macros, making it a popular choice for building custom macro keyboards.
You can choose from a list of boards that they have developed `here <https://docs.arduino.cc/>_`

This project uses Arduino Micro and Atmel Attiny85 as its base microcontrollers. You may use any microcontroller of your choice and make the necessary connections to the buttons and use it as your macro keyboard.

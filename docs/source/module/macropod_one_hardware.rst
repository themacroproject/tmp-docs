MacroPod One Hardware
===================


**Hardware:**
The Digispark Attiny85 is a small, low-cost microcontroller board that is compatible with the Arduino IDE. It is based on the ATtiny85 chip and comes with a USB connector, which allows it to be easily programmed and powered. Despite its small size, the Digispark Attiny85 is capable of running a wide range of programs and can be used for a variety of projects, such as controlling LEDs, motors, and sensors. It also has a number of built-in features, such as PWM output, analog-to-digital conversion, and support for I2C and SPI communication protocols. Its compact size makes it an ideal choice for projects where space is limited or portability is required.

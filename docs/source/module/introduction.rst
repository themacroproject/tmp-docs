Introduction
========

**Summary:**


An Arduino microcontroller can be used to build a custom macro keyboard by programming it to recognize specific keystrokes and perform a corresponding action, such as executing a macro or launching a program. This allows for automation and streamlining of repetitive tasks, as well as customization and personalization of the keyboard. 
We will mostly be using Arduino or Arduino IDE supported boards as they are highly customizable and is supported by a large community.

**Arduino:**


`Arduino <https://arduino.cc>`_ is an open-source electronics platform based on simple, easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of a `microcontroller <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller>_` board and a development environment for writing software, which can be used to control various devices and sensors. Arduino boards are commonly used for projects such as home automation, robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to their versatility, low cost, and ease of use. With a basic understanding of electronics and programming, anyone can use an Arduino to build and control a wide range of interactive devices.

**Arduino IDE:**
The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application used for programming and uploading code to an Arduino microcontroller board. The Arduino IDE provides a simple and user-friendly interface for writing, compiling, and uploading code to the board. It supports multiple programming languages, including C and C++, and includes libraries and examples to help users get started quickly. The Arduino IDE also allows for debugging and testing of code, making it a valuable tool for beginners and experienced users alike. Overall, the Arduino IDE provides a streamlined and accessible way for users to develop and control projects using an Arduino board.

===================================

Microchip ATTiny85:
-------------------
The ATtiny85 is a low-power, 8-bit microcontroller produced by Microchip Technology. It has 8 KB of flash memory, 512 bytes of SRAM, and 512 bytes of EEPROM, and operates at a clock speed of up to 20 MHz. It features 8 general-purpose I/O pins and supports various communication protocols such as SPI and USI for communication with other devices. The ATtiny85 is commonly used in small, battery-powered applications such as wearable devices and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

Arduino Nano:
-------------
The Arduino Nano is a compact microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 8 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a micro-USB port for programming, and operates at a voltage of 5V. The Nano board is compatible with the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE), allowing users to write, upload and debug code in a variety of programming languages such as C++. The Nano is often used for small-scale projects, educational purposes and hobbyist use due to its compact size, low cost and ease of use.

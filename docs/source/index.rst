Welcome to The Macro Project documentation!
===================================

**The Macro Project** is a open source project to help increase productivity of day to day tasks and workflows with the use of Macro Keyboards.
The ultimate open-source macro keyboard - designed for the power user who demands flexibility and customization. With its open-source firmware and programming capabilities, this keyboard allows you to fully customize and personalize your typing experience.

Unlike proprietary macro keyboards, an open-source macro keyboard gives you the freedom to modify and improve the firmware to your exact needs. You can create custom macros, remap keys, and even add new functionality. The open-source community also provides a wealth of resources, including tutorials, FAQs, and forums where you can share your work and learn from others.

With its durable design, customizable layout, and advanced programming capabilities, the open-source macro keyboard is perfect for gamers, programmers, and power users who want to take their productivity to the next level. Plus, you can be sure that your keyboard will continue to work and be supported with new updates and features.
